Servo signal happens every 20ms which means that the fastest control loop we can run is 50 Hz.


use 2 m/s as the test speed.

use car length of 8 inches
sensor is 4.5 inches ahead of front tires
turning angle of tires is 35 degrees

servo is Hextronik D-MG16
0.08 sec / 60 degrees

assume 0.08 sec per 35 degree of wheel turn
